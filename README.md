Features
Flask-Bcrypt: Secure password hashing.
Flask-WTF: Form validation and CSRF protection.
Flask-Talisman: HTTP security headers including Content Security Policy (CSP) and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
Input Validation: Ensures user inputs are safe and meet specified requirements.


Installation
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-flask-app.git
cd secure-flask-app

Create a Virtual Environment:

Security Considerations
Flask-Talisman: Automatically adds security headers to responses, enforcing HTTPS, preventing clickjacking, and more.
Input Validation: Ensures that all user inputs are validated to prevent common attacks like SQL Injection and XSS.
Password Hashing: Uses Flask-Bcrypt for securely hashing user passwords before storing them in the database.
CSRF Protection: Implemented via Flask-WTF to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
Testing


Manual Testing:
Test form submissions and observe the validation errors.
Check the browser’s developer tools for security headers.

Static Code Analysis:
Use tools like Bandit to analyze the code for potential security issues.

pip install bandit
bandit -r app.py


Automated Testing:
You can expand the project by adding automated tests using pytest or similar frameworks.
